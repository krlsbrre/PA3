# Python Data Analysis (Pandas) - Programming Assignment 3
This repository contains the solution for Programming Assignment #3 focused on Python Data Analysis using Pandas.

## Description
This repository contains two Python-based data analytics problems:

### Problem 1: Loading and Viewing Data
- Load the `cars.csv` file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Display the first and last five rows of the dataset.
### Problem 2: Data Manipulation Using Pandas
1. **Subsetting**:  
   - Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7…) of cars.
2. **Indexing**:
   - Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’.
3. **Data Querying**:
   - How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have?
4. **Complex Query**:
   - Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have.


## Getting Started
